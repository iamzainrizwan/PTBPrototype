# StudyQuest  

**StudyQuest** is a social learning application designed to tackle the challenges of motivation and focus during exam preparation. It combines **gamification**, **social collaboration**, and **scientifically-backed study techniques** to create a more engaging revision experience.  

At present, the project consists of two prototypes:  
- **UI Prototype (Figma):** A minimalist, space-themed interface showcasing the design and user flow.  
- **C# Command-Line Prototype:** A functional system demonstrating the underlying quest and reward mechanics.

## 🚀 Problem & Motivation  
Students often struggle with:  
- Staying motivated during revision.  
- Managing distractions in a digital-first environment.  
- Maintaining focus across different subject areas.  

This lack of effective study habits can lead to **stress, lower grades, and reduced confidence**.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
StudyQuest aims to:  
- Gamify studying by turning tasks into **quests** with rewards.  
- Use **active recall** reminders to strengthen memory retention.  
- Provide **social and competitive features** (groups, challenges, multiplayer quizzes).  
- Encourage consistency through **progress tracking** and visual feedback.

## 🛠️ Prototypes  

### 🔹 Figma UI Prototype  
- Minimalist space-exploration theme to symbolize progression.  
- One-handed navigation with a bottom bar for accessibility.  
- Color-coded subjects for a sleek, uncluttered design.  

### 🔹 C# Command-Line Prototype  
Core features:  
- Add and complete study quests.  
- Display quests in a table format.  
- Notify users of overdue tasks.  
- Learnings: library usage, table rendering, and documentation reading.  

---

## 📌 Future Work  
- Expand the Figma prototype with additional pages and **game-focused features**.  
- Improve backend efficiency (e.g., persistent quest tables instead of recreating them).  
- Add subject selection directly in the C# prototype.  
- Develop a full mobile app integrating both prototypes.  

---

## 📖 Key Learnings  
- **UI/UX Design** with Figma.  
- **Backend Logic** and libraries in C#.  
- **Version Control** with GitHub.  
- Practical application of **gamification and active recall research**.
